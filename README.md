# Changelog
- 0.1.1: Fixed the problem for menu items in a combo box.
- 0.3: Switched to using Dichotomy v3 as the base theme. Fixed some coloring issues in the taskbar.
- 0.3.1: Cleaned up the file to make it easier to work with. Changed the look of the buttons and menus on the panel. Fixed more incorrect coloring.
- 0.3.2: Fixed incorrect button coloring.

- 0.3.7: Made the highlights for mouse and keyboard focus more obvious.
